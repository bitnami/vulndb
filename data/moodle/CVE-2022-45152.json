  "description": "A blind Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerability was found in Moodle. This flaw exists due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input in LTI provider library. The library does not utilise Moodle's inbuilt cURL helper, which resulted in a blind SSRF risk. An attacker can send a specially crafted HTTP request and trick the application to initiate requests to arbitrary systems. This vulnerability allows a remote attacker to perform SSRF attacks.",
