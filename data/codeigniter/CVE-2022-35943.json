  "description": "Shield is an authentication and authorization framework for CodeIgniter 4. This vulnerability may allow [SameSite Attackers](https://canitakeyoursubdomain.name/) to bypass the [CodeIgniter4 CSRF protection](https://codeigniter4.github.io/userguide/libraries/security.html) mechanism with CodeIgniter Shield. For this attack to succeed, the attacker must have direct (or indirect, e.g., XSS) control over a subdomain site (e.g., `https://a.example.com/`) of the target site (e.g., `http://example.com/`). Upgrade to **CodeIgniter v4.2.3 or later** and **Shield v1.0.0-beta.2 or later**. As a workaround: set `Config\\Security::$csrfProtection` to `'session,'`remove old session data right after login (immediately after ID and password match) and regenerate CSRF token right after login (immediately after ID and password match)",
