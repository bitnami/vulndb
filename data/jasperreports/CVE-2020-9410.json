  "description": "The report generator component of TIBCO Software Inc.'s TIBCO JasperReports Library, TIBCO JasperReports Library for ActiveMatrix BPM, TIBCO JasperReports Server, TIBCO JasperReports Server for AWS Marketplace, and TIBCO JasperReports Server for ActiveMatrix BPM contains a vulnerability that theoretically allows an attacker to exploit HTML injection to gain full control of a web interface containing the output of the report generator component with the privileges of any user that views the affected report(s). The attacker can theoretically exploit this vulnerability when other users view a maliciously generated report, where those reports use Fusion Charts and a data source with contents controlled by the attacker. Affected releases are TIBCO Software Inc.'s TIBCO JasperReports Library: versions 7.1.1 and below, versions 7.2.0 and 7.2.1, version 7.3.0, version 7.5.0, TIBCO JasperReports Library for ActiveMatrix BPM: versions 7.1.1 and below, TIBCO JasperReports Server: versions 7.1.1 and below, version 7.2.0, version 7.5.0, TIBCO JasperReports Server for AWS Marketplace: versions 7.5.0 and below, and TIBCO JasperReports Server for ActiveMatrix BPM: versions 7.1.1 and below.",
