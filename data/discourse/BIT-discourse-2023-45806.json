  "details": "Discourse is an open source platform for community discussion. Prior to version 3.1.3 of the `stable` branch, if a user has been quoted and uses a `|` in their full name, they might be able to trigger a bug that generates a lot of duplicate content in all the posts they've been quoted by updating their full name again. Version 3.1.3 of the `stable` branch contain a patch for this issue. No known workaround exists, although one can stop the \"bleeding\" by ensuring users only use alphanumeric characters in their full name field.",
