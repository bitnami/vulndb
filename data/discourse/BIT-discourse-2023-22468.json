  "details": "Discourse is an open source platform for community discussion. Versions prior to 2.8.13 (stable), are vulnerable to cross-site Scripting. A maliciously crafted URL can be included in a post to carry out cross-site  scripting attacks on sites with disabled or overly permissive CSP (Content Security Policy). Discourse's default CSP prevents this vulnerability. This vulnerability is patched in version 2.8.13 (stable). As a workaround, enable and/or restore your site's CSP to the default one provided with Discourse.",
