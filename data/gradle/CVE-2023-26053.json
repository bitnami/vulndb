  "details": "Gradle is a build tool with a focus on build automation and support for multi-language development. This is a collision attack on long IDs (64bits) for PGP keys. Users of dependency verification in Gradle are vulnerable if they use long IDs for PGP keys in a `trusted-key` or `pgp` element in their dependency verification metadata file. The fix is to fail dependency verification if anything but a fingerprint is used in a trust element in dependency verification metadata. The problem is fixed in Gradle 8.0 and above. The problem is also patched in Gradle 6.9.4 and 7.6.1. As a workaround, use only full fingerprint IDs for `trusted-key` or `pgp` element in the metadata is a protection against this issue.",
