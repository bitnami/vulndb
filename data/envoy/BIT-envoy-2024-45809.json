  "details": "Envoy is a cloud-native high-performance edge/middle/service proxy. Jwt filter will lead to an Envoy crash when clear route cache with remote JWKs. In the following case: 1. remote JWKs are used, which requires async header processing; 2. clear_route_cache is enabled on the provider; 3. header operations are enabled in JWT filter, e.g. header to claims feature; 4. the routing table is configured in a way that the JWT header operations modify requests to not match any route. When these conditions are met, a crash is triggered in the upstream code due to nullptr reference conversion from route(). The root cause is the ordering of continueDecoding and clearRouteCache. This issue has been addressed in versions 1.31.2, 1.30.6, and 1.29.9. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.",
