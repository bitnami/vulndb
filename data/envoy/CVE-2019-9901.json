  "severity": "Critical",
  "description": "Envoy 1.9.0 and before does not normalize HTTP URL paths. A remote attacker may craft a relative path, e.g., something/../admin, to bypass access control, e.g., a block on /admin. A backend server could then interpret the non-normalized path and provide an attacker access beyond the scope provided for by the access control policy.",
