  "details": "WordPress 2.6.3 relies on the REQUEST superglobal array in certain dangerous situations, which makes it easier for remote attackers to conduct delayed and persistent cross-site request forgery (CSRF) attacks via crafted cookies, as demonstrated by attacks that (1) delete user accounts or (2) cause a denial of service (loss of application access).  NOTE: this issue relies on the presence of an independent vulnerability that allows cookie injection.",
