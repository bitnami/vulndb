  "description": "The default configuration in Elasticsearch before 1.2 enables dynamic scripting, which allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary MVEL expressions and Java code via the source parameter to _search.  NOTE: this only violates the vendor's intended security policy if the user does not run Elasticsearch in its own independent virtual machine.",
