  "description": "Flux is an open and extensible continuous delivery solution for Kubernetes. Path Traversal in the kustomize-controller via a malicious `kustomization.yaml` allows an attacker to expose sensitive data from the controllerâ€™s pod filesystem and possibly privilege escalation in multi-tenancy deployments. Workarounds include automated tooling in the user's CI/CD pipeline to validate `kustomization.yaml` files conform with specific policies. This vulnerability is fixed in kustomize-controller v0.24.0 and included in flux2 v0.29.0.",
