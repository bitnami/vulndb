  "description": "Revive Adserver before 3.2.3 suffers from Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF). The password recovery form in Revive Adserver is vulnerable to CSRF attacks. This vulnerability could be exploited to send a large number of password recovery emails to the registered users, especially in conjunction with a bug that caused recovery emails to be sent to all the users at once. Both issues have been fixed.",
