  "description": "The uri-block plugin in Apache APISIX before 2.10.2 uses $request_uri without verification. The $request_uri is the full original request URI without normalization. This makes it possible to construct a URI to bypass the block list on some occasions. For instance, when the block list contains \"^/internal/\", a URI like `//internal/` can be used to bypass it. Some other plugins also have the same issue. And it may affect the developer's custom plugin.",
