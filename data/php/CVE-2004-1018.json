  "description": "Multiple integer handling errors in PHP before 4.3.10 allow attackers to bypass safe mode restrictions, cause a denial of service, or execute arbitrary code via (1) a negative offset value to the shmop_write function, (2) an \"integer overflow/underflow\" in the pack function, or (3) an \"integer overflow/underflow\" in the unpack function.  NOTE: this issue was originally REJECTed by its CNA before publication, but that decision is in active dispute.  This candidate may change significantly in the future as a result of further discussion.",
