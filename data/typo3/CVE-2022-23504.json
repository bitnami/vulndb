Due to the lack of handling user-submitted YAML placeholder expressions in the site configuration backend module, attackers could expose sensitive internal information, such as system configuration or HTTP request messages of other website visitors. A valid backend user account having administrator privileges is needed to exploit this vulnerability. This issue has been patched in versions 9.5.38 ELTS, 10.4.33, 11.5.20, 12.1.1.",
