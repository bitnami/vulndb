  "summary": "Arbitrary memory read in `ImmutableConst`",
  "details": "TensorFlow is an open source platform for machine learning. In affected versions the `ImmutableConst` operation in TensorFlow can be tricked into reading arbitrary memory contents. This is because the `tstring` TensorFlow string class has a special case for memory mapped strings but the operation itself does not offer any support for this datatype. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.7.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.6.1, TensorFlow 2.5.2, and TensorFlow 2.4.4, as these are also affected and still in supported range.",
